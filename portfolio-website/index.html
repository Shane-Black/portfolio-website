            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I’ve had quite a diverse career. I started out as a police officer working across a number of divisions and making my way to the rank of Detective Senior Constable. I left the police after 7 years and started a career in wealth management. I worked for several banks before starting my own wealth management firm. I took this business from the start-up phase, acquired a few other businesses, and integrated them under one company umbrella. I sold this business with the intention to take a year off…</p>

            <p>… after 2 months, I got itchy feet and needed to do something so I combined my policing/investigative skills with my commercial nous and went back to work for a bank in their financial crime department.</p>
                
            <p>I am now studying full-stack software engineering to help solve problems that I have encountered during my professional experience.</p>
                
            <p>Away from work, I am a husband, a father to two boys, a fur-father to two dogs and I enjoy watching all sports and I participate in several martial arts.
